# AI Reasoner for Context-Aware Privacy Risk Inference in Connected Vehicles
DriveWise is a privacy-aware context management system for connected vehicles. This proof of concept focuses on dynamic risk inference based on semantic reasoning over user context, data sharing preferences, and real-time situations. It integrates OWL ontologies, SWRL rules, and a reasoner to detect potential privacy risks and support informed decision-making.
The code is implemented in JAVA 8 using the OWL API, SWRL API and the Pellet reasoner.
